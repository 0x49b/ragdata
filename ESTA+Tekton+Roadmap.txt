ESTA Tekton Roadmap

The following roadmap is just an internal draft and thus shall not be
taken as a commitment. Furthermore it's subject to change at any time.

Planned Features for ESTA Tekton

This is a loose collection of high-level features we plan to integrate
into the ESTA Tekton CI/CD system.

Prio 1

-   estaCloudPipeline.json Migration tool :tick:

-   Full Buildpacks support :tick:

-   Tekton Namespace Setup via CLEW SSP :tick:

Prio 2

-   Parametrized Builds (via Tekton Control Panel)

-   JUnit, Cucumber (+ other) test report publishing

Prio 3

-   Python Support :tick:

-   Selectable Maven Versions (SDKman?)

Later

-   Mobile Build + Deployment

-   Hotfix Creation Assistant

-   Advanced Pipeline Configuration via YAML (like Github actions)

Out-of-scope Features

-   Kafka Deployment

-   APIM Registration

-   Azure AD App Registration

-   Solace Deployment (TMS)

-   Pre and Post Hooks in staging pipelines (preCiDeploymentJob,
    postCiDeploymentJob)

These are topics specific to deployment and therefore are not an
integrated part of ESTA Tekton which delegates deployment to ArgoCD.
Solutions will be discussed with the CLEW Architect and eventually
provided by CLEW.

Other TODOs for ESTA Tekton
