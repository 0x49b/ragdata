ESTA Tekton Pipeline

The ESTA Tekton Pipeline provides an easy-to-use CI/CD system with a
standardized process for building and deploying your software projects
on Openshift.

The key benefits for using ESTA Tekton are:

-   Easy setup for projects using the standard SBB stacks like
    SpringBoot, Angular/Typescript and Go

-   Simple build configuration with a single JSON file similar to the
    well known estaCloudPipeline.json

-   Fast migration for builds from ESTA Cloud Pipeline (the deployment
    part needs a little more effort)

-   Makes use of Lean Gitflow and Semantic Versioning

-   Scalable build infrastructure using dedicated Openshift 4 clusters

-   Extensible using custom pipelines and individual build namespaces

-   Standard ESTA Tekton Pipelines with options to be customized

-   Customized builder images if necessary

-   Flexible pipeline configurations which get triggered by User, REST
    API or Bitbucket Webhooks
